## Project Focus

This project was created to run different machine learning regression algorithms on a set of data containing 395 students.  The data includes their responses to a survey, measures of different environmental factors on the students, and their performance in their mathematics course.  The main part of the project is contained in modelbuilding3.  Other model building and data cleaning experimentations are contained in the other files.  My charts and graphs were created in the visualization file.  

## Steps in the Project
### 1.  A goal was studied and determined.
### 2.  An appropriate data set was selected.
### 3.  Exploratory data analysis was performed.
+   Data attributes were observed
+   Data types were determined
+   Data was cleaned.
    + Attributes seperated into columns in excel       
    + Unwanted attributes were dropped
    + Categorical variables were changed to integers.
    + Data was checked for duplicates and null values.
+   Shapes of data attributes were observed.
+   Data attributes were checked for relationships.
### 4. Machine learning algorithms were run on the data.
+   Pipelines were created using four different regression algorithms.
+   Data was split into 80/20 train/test split
+   Data was fit.  
+   Different algorithms were judged on the accuracy of their prediction and their mean absolute errors.
### 5.  Conclusions were made about which model performed best making predictions.
### 6.  Visualizations were created to better illustrate our results.
