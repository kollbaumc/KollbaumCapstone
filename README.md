## Project Focus

This project was created to run different machine learning regression algorithms on a set of data containing 395 students.  The data includes their responses to a survey, measures of different environmental factors on the students, and their performance in their mathematics course.  

## Steps in the Project
### 1.  A goal was studied and determined.
### 2.  An appropriate data set was selected.
### 3.  Exploratory data analysis was performed.
+   Data attributes were observed
+   Data types were determined
+   Data was cleaned.
 * Unwanted attributes were dropped
#####        2.  Categorical variables were changed to integers.
#####        3.  Data was checked for duplicates and null values.
####    d.  Shapes of data attributes were observed.
####    e.  Data attributes were checked for relationships.
### 4. Machine learning algorithms were run on the data.
####    a.  Pipelines were created using four different regression algorithms.
####    b.  Data was split into 80/20 train/test split
####    c.  Data was fit.  
####    d.  Different algorithms were judged on the accuracy of their prediction and their mean absolute errors.
### 5.  Conclusions were made about which model performed best making predictions.
### 6.  Visualizations were created to better illustrate our results.
